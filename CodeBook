# Variables used in the R script
1.  train_x ,  train_y ,  train_subject contain the data from the "train" folder
    test_x ,  test_y ,  test_subject contain the data from the "test" folder.
2. Subject, Activity and Features merge the previous datasets using rbind
3. "final" is an intermdiate dataset merging Subject,, Activity, Features, which labels the data set with descriptive variable names
4. Tidy_Data is a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# The tidy_data file contains 10299 observations with 81 variables divided in:
1. subject: The ID of the test subject
2. activity: The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. There are six possible activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRs, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
3. a 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables (numeric). ex: tbodyacc-mean-x, tbodyacc-mean-y etc...
